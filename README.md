# Introduction
`pdns-api-scripts` is a collection of shell scripts for manipulating records in PowerDNS via its REST API.

# Installation
(TBW)

# USAGE

(TBW) For now, it's enough to know that every script has a `-h` flag that provides usage information, and that there is
a `USAGE="..."` string at the top of every script.  Use the source, Luke.
